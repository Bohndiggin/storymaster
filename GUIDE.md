## Concepts

- _Setting:_ Settings are worlds. Multiple storylines can happen in one world. The Lore is attached to the setting so you can make a series of stories without rewriting all the lore.

- _Storyline:_ Storylines are the plots of your worlds. They are made up of Sections and Sections have Nodes.

### Litographer Concepts

- _Section:_ A section is a part of the storyline. It maps generally to Aristotle's plot structure. I.e. exposition is one section. You can also line them up with Acts if you want to go that route. Sections come in types such as:
  - Tension Sustains.
  - Tension Increases.
  - Singular Moment.
  - Tension Lowers.

```
